***Currently, I enjoy working with TailwindCSS, ReactJS, Node.js, and Firebase.***

## Current Project

**Pactify ¬∑ Goal Setting App | Dev & Designer
[Pactify](https://pactify.netlify.app/)**

I decided to build something that would help keep myself accountable with the goals I had. I wanted to have something interactive and something where it would give me positive feedback when completing a goal. Thus, Pactify became my baby. I built Pactify with React.js and TailwindCSS. For backend, I decided with Google Firebaseüî• to house the database and for authentication purposes. Throughout the process, I have found a new passion for development. Creating a UI that is interactive and sleek. I am still currently working on this, as I plan to create a mobile version using react native. However, I would like to build a progression feature showing your progression towards each individual goal. However, this is the beta version! Enjoy!

## Freelance Work

**Sam Warder ¬∑ Custom Portfolio for Digital Marketing Expert | Dev & Designer
[Sam Warder](https://samwarder.netlify.app/)**

I built this website using React.js and TailwindCSS for a sleek and responsive design. The design follows a clean, minimalistic, and fully responsive layout, utilizing Flexbox and Grid for structure. Custom animations and interactive elements powered by JavaScript add to the user experience, while performance is optimized through image compression and lazy loading. I implemented some animations that weren't normally used as background effects to show the out of the box thinking. This project reflects a modern approach to web development, designed for performance, security, and scalability.
